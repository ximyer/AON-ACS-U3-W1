# Unit 3: Project Rosalind üß¨

## Tier 1 üî¨

#### Overview: 
Students will solve a few of the more straight-forward problems as an introduction into solving bioinformatics problems and working with the live and large datasets inherent to the field. 

- Go to Project Rosalind, create an account, and take the tour to familarize yourself with the website. 
- Many of the problems in this project are string manipulation problems. Review strings in your chosen language and familiarize with the sorts of things you can do with a string. You can always reference the functionality later. 
- Create a replit for this project. 
- Create a planning document. 
- Complete the following problems. For each problem, think about what is being asked, develop an algorithm in pseudocode that you put into your planning document, implement the problem and test with the example data provided, then test again with the larger datasets. Upload a screen capture from Project Rosalind of each successfully completed problem into your replit.
- Counting DNA nucleotides
- Transcribing DNA to RNA
- Complementing DNA
- Computing GC Content
- Counting Point Mutations
- Finding a Motif in DNA
- Transitions and Transversions
